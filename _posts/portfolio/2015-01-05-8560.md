### Project Description

This beautiful prototype rise from the desire of the Exhibitions Team of We The Curious wanting our vistors to experience seeing where rainbows are happening all over the world.

<div style="text-align:center;">
	<video src="videos/8560.mp4" poster="img/portfolio/8560.png" width="320" height="200" controls preload></video>
</div>	

The application scrapes Instagram using the wanted hashtags ("@rainbow","@real-rainbow") to then geocode this data on a Google Map.

We prototyped this exhibition in a large 50" touchscreen.


### Contributions

Some of the tasks we split up amongst ourselves were:

- Design application that scrapes Instagram and shows the data on a map
- Include moderation page to remove unwanted pictures
- Build prototype to proof the concept with visitors

### Challenges Overcame

It was fun to learn more about the Instagram API and geodata. 

### Accomplishments

The greatest accomplishment of this project was that our prototype was a great success among visitors who tested it. We received a great feedback, the final version will look beautiful.
