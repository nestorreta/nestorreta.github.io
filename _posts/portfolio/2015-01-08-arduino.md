### Project Description

We wanted to see if we could host applications for exhibitions in a BrightSign and easily connect buttons or other peripherals. We tried both communication via the serial port and the MQTT protocol.

The goal was to build a start and stop button that interacts with a BrightSign.

This is a video of the first prototype:

### Contributions

With the help of Bruce Badman, our electronics expert at We The Curious, my primary contributions were:

* Design proof of concept
* Write code for ESP32 and BrightSign
* Test & improvements

### Challenges Overcame

This was an exciting challenge as I had to face two new technologies for me: ESP32 Arduino and BrightSign signage devices.

The biggest challenge was to write the middleware to communicate both devices.

### Accomplishments

It was a successful proof of concept and really fun to work with physical buttons.
Thanks Bruce for all your lessons about electronics!

The skills I developed most were:

* Remember C++ I studied in College :)
* ESP32 Development Board
* Arduino IDE
* BrightScript
