### Project Description

Working with the Exhibitions team of We The Curious I had the task to build basic prototypes as proof of concept for future exhibitions.

The were tested with real visitors. The feedback collected will be very useful for the final versions of the exhibitions.

Some examples:

## Camouflage touch-screen app

<div style="text-align:center;">
   <video src="videos/8450.mp4" poster="img/portfolio/8450.png" width="320" height="200" controls preload></video>
</div>

## Video slider touch-screen app

<div style="text-align:center;">
   <video src="videos/8442.mp4" poster="img/portfolio/8442.png" width="320" height="200" controls preload></video>
</div>

## Personality survey

<div style="text-align:center;">
   <video src="videos/8110.mp4" poster="img/portfolio/8110.png" width="320" height="200" controls preload></video>
</div>

## Content reader

<div style="text-align:center;">
   <video src="videos/8770.mp4" poster="img/portfolio/8770.png" width="320" height="200" controls preload></video>
</div>



### Contributions

Design and deployment of basic prototypes to use on touch-screens


### Challenges Overcame

Working with a Team going through the proccess of having an idea to an application. 

This project gave me the chance to learn about this proccess. 


### Accomplishments

We managed to build several prototypes very quickly, make changes rapidly according the visitors feedback.

This process will give us a better final exhibitions :)
