### Project Description

We are working towards the modernitazion of our website at We The Curious.

The goal was to build a set of web services that this platform could flexibly and safely pass customer enrollment and payment information integrating our CRM. This included:

* Tokenization of payment information
* Reception of enrollment from the platform
* Transformation from received enrollment into CRM formats
* Submission of enrollments and payment information to CRM 

### Contributions

As back-end developer in this project, my primary contributions are:

* Middleware between Frontend and our CRM (Tessitura)
* Payment tokenization and encryption
* Test harness for tokenization
* Submission of enrollments to our CRM
* Deploy AWS enviroment to host front-end, middleware, CMS (Strapi), API Gateway
* Set up synchronization between CRM and CMS

### Challenges Overcame

This was my first experience building something that tokenized and encrypted actual payment information which was a high-security, business-critical task. This involved a variety of encryption techniques and software to accomplish.

The biggest challenge was the design to make sure it is fast and secure between all the components. The CRM hosting the bussiness data, CMS hosting data for the front-end, payments, encryption...


### Accomplishments

This was a brand new business venture and a new concept in the development of web services.

The skills I developed most were:

* Web service security techniques and standards
* AWS services
* Service-oriented architecture focus
* Encryption and tokenization
* Database managament
